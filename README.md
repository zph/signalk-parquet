Vessel data Parquet file archive with automated value and geospatial triggers. History API compliant with cloud backups and queries.

## Features

### Core Data Management
- **Smart Data Types**: Intelligent Parquet schema detection preserves native data types (DOUBLE, BOOLEAN) instead of forcing everything to strings
- **Daily Export Pipeline**: Simplified daily export creates consolidated Parquet files directly
  - Data accumulates in SQLite buffer throughout the day
  - Single export at configurable hour (default: 4 AM UTC)
  - No separate consolidation step needed
- **SQLite WAL Buffering**: Crash-safe data ingestion with Write-Ahead Logging
  - Replaces in-memory buffers with persistent SQLite database
  - Automatic recovery after power loss or crashes
  - 48-hour retention for federated queries
  - Per-path tables (`buffer_navigation_position`, etc.) for partition-aligned access
  - `buffer_tables` metadata table tracks path→table mapping
- **Hive-Partitioned Storage**: Efficient file organization for query performance
  - Structure: `tier=raw/context={ctx}/path={path}/year={year}/day={day}/`
  - Aggregation tiers: `raw`, `5s`, `60s`, `1h`
  - Automatic partition pruning for time-range queries
  - **Bulk Aggregation**: `POST /api/aggregate/bulk` builds all tiers from raw data in one background job
  - **Post-Migration Aggregation**: Migration automatically builds tiers after moving files to hive structure
  - **Position Aggregation Migration**: `POST /api/migrate/position-aggregation` re-aggregates position paths (`value_latitude`/`value_longitude`) into 5s/60s/1h tiers
    - Auto-detects position paths in the raw tier by schema
    - GPS outlier rejection via `POSITION_MAX_SPEED_MPS` (25 m/s ≈ 48.6 kn) to discard single-point glitches
    - Supports `dryRun` for previewing
- **Batched Parquet Writing**: Streams records to Parquet in pull-based batches instead of loading all rows into memory
  - Reduces peak memory during large exports from the SQLite buffer
- **Cloud Federated Querying**: Query historical data directly from S3 or Cloudflare R2 using DuckDB's native support
  - Three-tier query hierarchy: local parquet → cloud supplement → SQLite buffer
  - Automatic partition pruning reduces data transfer by 70-90%
  - Predicate pushdown filters data at source before transfer
- **Auto-Discovery**: Automatically configure paths when first queried
  - On-demand path configuration when History API queries unconfigured paths
  - Include/exclude glob patterns for fine-grained control
  - Optional live data requirement before configuration
- **Vector Averaging**: Correct aggregation of angular data (headings, bearings, wind angles)
  - Automatic detection of angular paths via SignalK metadata (`units === 'rad'`)
  - Uses `atan2(mean(sin), mean(cos))` instead of arithmetic mean
  - Lossless re-aggregation across tiers via stored sin/cos averages
- **Buffer Bucketing**: SQLite buffer data bucketed to match Parquet query resolution
  - Prevents raw per-second records from flooding bucketed query results
  - Supports all aggregate methods including vector averaging for angular paths
- **Dynamic Regimen Control**: Data subscriptions update in real-time when regimen commands are received
  - No plugin restart needed to activate/deactivate recording regimens
  - Regimen state changes via SignalK commands immediately start/stop path recording
- **GPX Track Import**: Load historical GPX tracks (other vessels, handhelds, archived logs) directly into the Hive-partitioned parquet store, bypassing the live SignalK subscription path
  - Drag-and-drop browser upload from the Status tab, or "Advanced" server-directory mode for USB-drive bulk imports on the host
  - Dependency-free GPX 1.0 / 1.1 parser extracts `<trkpt>` lat/lon/time plus optional `<ele>`, `<speed>`, `<course>`; `<course>` is converted from degrees to radians to match `navigation.courseOverGroundTrue`
  - Job-based with per-`jobId` cancellation, progress polling, and 30-minute TTL on finished jobs
  - Browser upload caps: 50 MB per file, 500 files per request

### Data Validation & Schema Repair
- **Schema Validation**: Comprehensive validation of Parquet file schemas against SignalK metadata standards
- **Automated Repair**: One-click repair of schema violations with proper data type conversion
- **Type Correction**: Automatic conversion of incorrectly stored data types (e.g., numeric strings → DOUBLE, boolean strings → BOOLEAN)
- **Metadata Integration**: Uses SignalK metadata (units, types) to determine correct data types for marine measurements
- **Safe Operations**: Creates backups before repair and quarantines corrupted files for safety
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress monitoring with cancellation support for large datasets

#### Benefits of Proper Data Types
Using correct data types in Parquet files provides significant advantages:
- **Storage Efficiency**: Numeric data stored as DOUBLE uses ~50% less space than string representations
- **Query Performance**: Native numeric operations are 5-10x faster than string parsing during analysis
- **Data Integrity**: Type validation prevents data corruption and ensures consistent analysis results
- **Analytics Compatibility**: Proper types enable advanced statistical analysis and machine learning applications
- **Compression**: Parquet's columnar compression works optimally with correctly typed data

#### Validation Process
The validation system checks each Parquet file for:
- **Field Type Consistency**: Ensures numeric marine data (position, speed, depth) is stored as DOUBLE
- **Boolean Representation**: Validates true/false values are stored as BOOLEAN, not strings
- **Metadata Alignment**: Compares file schemas against SignalK metadata for units like meters, volts, amperes
- **Schema Standards**: Enforces data best practices for long-term data integrity

### Advanced Querying
- **SignalK History API Compliance**: Full compliance with SignalK History API specifications
  - **Standard Time Parameters**: All 5 standard query patterns supported
  - **Time-Filtered Discovery**: Paths and contexts filtered by time range using hive partition directory names (no file scanning)
  - **Optional Analytics**: Moving averages (EMA/SMA) available on demand
- **🌍 ISO 8601 Timestamps**: All timestamps returned in server local time with offset (e.g., `2025-10-20T12:34:04-04:00`)
- **Flexible Time Querying**: Multiple ways to specify time ranges
  - Query from now, from specific times, or between time ranges
  - Duration-based windows (1h, 30m, 2d) for easy relative queries
  - Forward and backward time querying support
- **Time Alignment**: Automatic alignment of data from different sensors using time bucketing
- **DuckDB Integration**: Direct SQL querying of Parquet files with type-safe operations
- **Spatial Analysis**: Advanced geographic analysis with DuckDB spatial extension
  - **Track Analysis**: Calculate vessel tracks, distances, and movement patterns
  - **Proximity Detection**: Multi-vessel distance calculations and collision risk analysis
  - **Geographic Visualization**: Generate movement boundaries, centroids, and spatial statistics
  - **Route Planning**: Historical track analysis for route optimization and performance analysis
  - **Spatial Correlation**: Filter any sensor data by vessel location
    - Query "wind data when vessel was within this area"
    - Bounding box (`bbox`) and radius filters work on all paths
    - Automatically correlates timestamps with position data
  - **Spatial Context Discovery**: Find vessels by geographic area
    - `GET /api/history/contexts/spatial?bbox=...` or `radius=...`
    - Single DuckDB query on `navigation__position` files with hive partition pruning

### Management & Control
- **Command Management**: Register, execute, and manage SignalK commands with automatic path configuration
- **Regimen-Based Data Collection**: Control data collection with command-based regimens
- **Multi-Vessel Support**: Wildcard vessel contexts (`vessels.*`) with MMSI-based exclusion filtering
  - **Context-Aware Path Discovery**: `/history/paths?context=vessels.urn:mrn:imo:mmsi:NNNNN` returns paths for any tracked vessel
- **Source Filtering**: Filter data by SignalK source labels (bypasses server arbitration for raw data access)
- **Comprehensive REST API**: Full programmatic control of queries and configuration

### User Interface & Integration
- **Responsive Web Interface**: Complete web-based management interface
- **Map Explorer**: Interactive spatial query and visualization tab
  - Draw bounding box or radius areas on a Leaflet map to query vessel data geographically
  - Multi-path overlay (up to 3 paths) with color-coded track, chart, and data table
  - Searchable path selector with checkbox list and removable chips
  - Display values in user-configured units via SignalK metadata (`displayUnits`)
  - Playback controls with scrub slider for time-series review
  - Export to CSV, GeoJSON, KML; save as SignalK waypoints, tracks, or routes
  - OpenSeaMap nautical chart overlay
  - Save/load named geographic areas with server sync via SignalK Resources API (shared with ZedDisplay)
  - High-resolution track option for maximum route fidelity when saving routes
  - Vessel name display in context dropdown with searchable filter
  - Auto-selects first data point after query for immediate detail view
- **Cloud Storage Integration**: Upload files to Amazon S3 or Cloudflare R2 as part of the daily export pipeline
- **Context Support**: Support for multiple vessel contexts with exclusion controls

### Regimen System (Advanced)
- **Operational Context Tracking**: Define regimens for operational states (mooring, anchoring, racing, passage-making)
- **Command-Based Episodes**: Track state transitions using SignalK commands as regimen triggers
- **Episode Boundary Detection**: Sophisticated SQL-based detection of operational periods using CTEs and window functions
- **Contextual Data Collection**: Link SignalK paths to regimens for targeted data analysis during specific operations
- **Web Interface Management**: Create, edit, and manage regimens and command keywords through the web UI

### Threshold Automation
- **Per-Command Conditions**: Each regimen/command can define one or more thresholds that watch a single SignalK path.
- **True-Only Actions**: On every path update the condition is evaluated; when it is true the command is set to the threshold's `activateOnMatch` state (ON/OFF). False evaluations leave the command untouched, so use a second threshold if you want a different level to switch it back.
- **Stable Triggers**: Optional hysteresis (seconds) suppresses re-firing while the condition remains true, preventing rapid toggling in noisy data.
- **Multiple Thresholds Per Path**: Unique monitor keys allow several thresholds to observe the same SignalK path without cancelling each other.
- **Unit Handling**: Threshold values must match the live SignalK units (e.g., fractional 0–1 SoC values). Angular thresholds are entered in degrees in the UI and stored as radians automatically.
- **Automation State Machine**: When enabling automation, command is set to OFF then all thresholds are immediately evaluated. When disabling automation, threshold monitoring stops and command state remains unchanged. Default state is hardcoded to OFF on server side.

- **Custom Analysis**: Create custom analysis prompts for specific operational needs

## Requirements

### Core Requirements
- SignalK Server v2.13+
- Node.js 22.5+ (required for `node:sqlite` — the built-in SQLite module used for crash-safe buffering; on Node < 22.5 the buffer falls back to in-memory LRU)

```

## Configuration

### Plugin Configuration

Navigate to **SignalK Admin → Server → Plugin Config → SignalK Parquet Data Store**

Configure basic plugin settings (path configuration is managed separately in the web interface):

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Buffer Size** | Number of records to buffer before writing | 1000 |
| **Save Interval** | How often to save buffered data (seconds) | 30 |
| **Output Directory** | Directory to save data files | SignalK data directory |
| **Filename Prefix** | Prefix for generated filenames | `signalk_data` |
| **File Format** | Output format (parquet, json, csv) | `parquet` |
| **Raw Parquet Compression** | Compression for raw-tier Parquet files (`SNAPPY` or `UNCOMPRESSED`) | `SNAPPY` |
| **Retention Days** | Days to keep processed files | 7 |
| **Daily Export Hour** | Hour (0-23 UTC) to run daily Parquet export | 4 |
| **Export Batch Size** | Max records to export per cycle (1,000-200,000) | 50000 |
| **Buffer Retention Hours** | How long to keep exported records in SQLite (hours) | 48 |
| **Enable Raw SQL** | Enable /api/query endpoint for raw SQL queries | `false` |

### Auto-Discovery Configuration

Configure automatic path discovery when querying unconfigured paths:

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Enable Auto-Discovery** | Master switch for auto-discovery | `false` |
| **Require Live Data** | Only configure if path has live SignalK data | `true` |
| **Max Auto-Configured Paths** | Maximum number of auto-configured paths | `100` |
| **Include Patterns** | Glob patterns for paths to include (e.g., `navigation.*`) | `[]` |
| **Exclude Patterns** | Glob patterns for paths to exclude (e.g., `propulsion.*`) | `[]` |

When enabled, Auto-Discovery will automatically add path configurations when:
1. A History API query requests data for an unconfigured path
2. The path matches include patterns (if specified)
3. The path doesn't match exclude patterns
4. The path has live data in SignalK (if `requireLiveData` is enabled)

Auto-discovered paths are marked with the `autoDiscovered: true` flag and have auto-generated human-readable names prefixed with `[Auto]`.

### Cloud Upload Configuration

Configure cloud storage upload in the plugin configuration. Uploads run as part of the daily export pipeline.

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Provider** | Cloud provider: `none`, `s3`, or `r2` | `none` |
| **Bucket** | Bucket name | - |
| **Region** | AWS region (S3 only) | `us-east-1` |
| **Account ID** | Cloudflare account ID (R2 only) | - |
| **Key Prefix** | Object key prefix | - |
| **Access Key ID** | Cloud credentials | - |
| **Secret Access Key** | Cloud credentials | - |
| **Custom Endpoint URL** | Override the S3 endpoint for self-hosted S3-compatible storage (Garage, MinIO). Include protocol and port, e.g. `https://garage.example.com:3900` (S3 only) | - |
| **Use Path-Style Addressing** | Path-style bucket addressing (`https://endpoint/bucket`); often required by self-hosted services. Defaults to enabled when a custom endpoint is set | auto |
| **Allow Private/Local Endpoints** | Permit custom endpoints on private/loopback/link-local addresses (e.g. `192.168.x.x`, `localhost`). Required for self-hosted storage on the boat LAN; off by default to prevent SSRF (since v0.7.44-beta.2) | `false` |
| **Delete After Upload** | Delete local files after upload | `false` |

> **Upload timeouts (v0.7.44+):** cloud requests are bounded (10 s to connect, 60 s per request) so a dead or stalled uplink fails the upload — which is retried — instead of hanging the daily export pipeline.

## Path Configuration

**Important**: Path configuration is managed exclusively through the web interface, not in the SignalK admin interface. This provides a more intuitive interface for managing data collection paths.

### Accessing Path Configuration

1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/plugins/signalk-parquet`
2. Click the **⚙️ Path Configuration** tab

### Adding Data Paths

Use the web interface to configure which SignalK paths to collect:

1. Click **➕ Add New Path**
2. Configure the path settings:
   - **SignalK Path**: The SignalK data path (e.g., `navigation.position`)
   - **Always Enabled**: Collect data regardless of regimen state
   - **Regimen Control**: Command name that controls collection
   - **Source Filter**: Only collect from specific sources
   - **Context**: SignalK context (`vessels.self`, `vessels.*`, or specific vessel)
   - **Exclude MMSI**: For `vessels.*` context, exclude specific MMSI numbers
3. Click **✅ Add Path**

### Managing Existing Paths

- **Edit Path**: Click ✏️ Edit button to modify path settings
- **Delete Path**: Click 🗑️ Remove button to delete a path
- **Refresh**: Click 🔄 Refresh Paths to reload configuration
- **Show/Hide Commands**: Toggle button to show/hide command paths in the table

### Command Management

The plugin streamlines command management with automatic path configuration:

1. **Register Command**: Commands are automatically registered with enabled path configurations
2. **Start Command**: Click **Start** button to activate a command regimen
3. **Stop Command**: Click **Stop** button to deactivate a command regimen
4. **Remove Command**: Click **Remove** button to delete a command and its path configuration

This eliminates the previous 3-step process of registering commands, adding paths, and enabling them separately.

### Path Configuration Storage

Path configurations are stored separately from plugin configuration in:
```
~/.signalk/signalk-parquet/webapp-config.json
```

This allows for:
- Independent management of path configurations
- Better separation of concerns
- Easier backup and migration of path settings
- More intuitive web-based configuration interface

### Regimen-Based Control

Regimens allow you to control data collection based on SignalK commands:

**Example**: Weather data collection with source filtering
```json
{
  "path": "environment.wind.angleApparent",
  "enabled": false,
  "regimen": "captureWeather",
  "source": "mqtt-weatherflow-udp",
  "context": "vessels.self"
}
```

**Note**: Source filtering accesses raw data before SignalK server arbitration, allowing collection of data from specific sources that might otherwise be filtered out.

**Multi-Vessel Example**: Collect navigation data from all vessels except specific MMSI numbers
```json
{
  "path": "navigation.position",
  "enabled": true,
  "context": "vessels.*",
  "excludeMMSI": ["123456789", "987654321"]
}
```

**Command Path**: Command paths are automatically created when registering commands
```json
{
  "path": "commands.captureWeather",
  "enabled": true,
  "context": "vessels.self"
}
```

This path will only collect data when the command `commands.captureWeather` is active.

## TypeScript Architecture

### Type Safety

The plugin uses comprehensive TypeScript interfaces:

```typescript
interface PluginConfig {
  bufferSize: number;
  saveIntervalSeconds: number;
  outputDirectory: string;
  filenamePrefix: string;
  fileFormat: 'json' | 'csv' | 'parquet';
  parquetCompression: 'SNAPPY' | 'UNCOMPRESSED';
  retentionDays: number;
  vesselMMSI: string;
  cloudUpload: CloudUploadConfig;
  useSqliteBuffer?: boolean;
  exportBatchSize?: number;
  bufferRetentionHours?: number;
  useHivePartitioning?: boolean;
  dailyExportHour?: number;
  autoDiscovery?: AutoDiscoveryConfig;
  enableRawSql?: boolean;
}

interface CloudUploadConfig {
  provider: 'none' | 's3' | 'r2';
  bucket?: string;
  region?: string;       // S3 only
  accountId?: string;    // R2 only (Cloudflare account ID)
  keyPrefix?: string;
  accessKeyId?: string;
  secretAccessKey?: string;
  deleteAfterUpload?: boolean;
}

interface PathConfig {
  path: string;
  name?: string;
  enabled?: boolean;
  regimen?: string;
  source?: string;
  context?: string;
  excludeMMSI?: string[];
  autoDiscovered?: boolean;
}

interface DataRecord {
  received_timestamp: string;
  signalk_timestamp: string;
  context: string;
  path: string;
  value: any;
  source_label?: string;
  meta?: string;
}
```

### Plugin State Management

The plugin maintains typed state:

```typescript
interface PluginState {
  unsubscribes: Array<() => void>;
  dataBuffers: LRUCache<string, DataRecord[]>;
  activeRegimens: Set<string>;
  subscribedPaths: Set<string>;
  parquetWriter?: ParquetWriter;
  cloudClient?: any;
  currentConfig?: PluginConfig;
  sqliteBuffer?: SQLiteBufferInterface;
  exportService?: ParquetExportServiceInterface;
  commandState: CommandRegistrationState;
}
```

### Express Router Types

API routes are fully typed:

```typescript
router.get('/api/paths', 
  (_: TypedRequest, res: TypedResponse<PathsApiResponse>) => {
    // Typed request/response handling
  }
);
```

## Data Output Structure

### File Organization (Hive-Partitioned)

The plugin uses Hive-style partitioned paths for efficient querying:

```
output_directory/
├── tier=raw/
│   ├── context=vessels__self/
│   │   ├── path=navigation__position/
│   │   │   ├── year=2025/
│   │   │   │   ├── day=197/
│   │   │   │   │   ├── data_20250716T120000.parquet
│   │   │   │   │   └── data_20250716T130000.parquet
│   │   │   │   └── day=198/
│   │   │   │       └── data_20250717T080000.parquet
│   │   │   └── year=2024/
│   │   │       └── day=365/
│   │   └── path=navigation__speedOverGround/
│   └── context=vessels__urn-mrn-imo-mmsi-368396230/
│       └── path=navigation__position/
├── tier=5s/
│   └── [aggregated 5-second data]
├── tier=60s/
│   └── [aggregated 1-minute data]
├── tier=1h/
│   └── [aggregated hourly data]
├── buffer.db              <- SQLite WAL buffer (48h retention)
└── buffer.db-wal          <- Write-ahead log
```

**Partition Structure:**
- `tier=` - Aggregation level: `raw`, `5s`, `60s`, `1h`
- `context=` - Vessel context (sanitized: `.` → `__`, `:` → `-`)
- `path=` - SignalK path (sanitized: `.` → `__`)
- `year=` - Year (e.g., `2025`)
- `day=` - Day of year, zero-padded (e.g., `197`)

> **Legacy flat structure**: If you have data from pre-Hive versions, use the Migration API to convert to Hive partitioning. See [Data Migration](#data-migration).

## Data Migration

### Migrating Legacy Files to Hive Partitioning

If you have existing data in the legacy flat structure, use the Migration API to convert to Hive partitioning:

**1. Scan for migratable files:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/plugins/signalk-parquet/api/migrate/scan \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"sourceDirectory": "/path/to/data"}'
```

Response includes:
- Total files to migrate
- Total size in bytes
- Files grouped by SignalK path
- Estimated migration time

**2. Start migration:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/plugins/signalk-parquet/api/migrate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "sourceDirectory": "/path/to/data",
    "targetDirectory": "/path/to/data",
    "targetTier": "raw",
    "deleteSourceAfterMigration": false
  }'
```

**3. Check progress:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/plugins/signalk-parquet/api/migrate/progress/{jobId}
```

**4. Cancel if needed:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/plugins/signalk-parquet/api/migrate/cancel/{jobId}
```

**Migration Options:**
| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `sourceDirectory` | Source directory to scan | Plugin data directory |
| `targetDirectory` | Target directory for Hive files | Same as source |
| `targetTier` | Target aggregation tier | `raw` |
| `deleteSourceAfterMigration` | Delete source files after successful migration | `false` |

### Data Schema

Each record contains:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `received_timestamp` | string | When the plugin received the data |
| `signalk_timestamp` | string | Original SignalK timestamp |
| `context` | string | SignalK context (e.g., `vessels.self`) |
| `path` | string | SignalK path |
| `value` | DOUBLE/BOOLEAN/INT64/UTF8 | **Smart typed values** - numbers stored as DOUBLE, booleans as BOOLEAN, etc. |
| `value_json` | string | JSON representation for complex values |
| `source` | string | Complete source information |
| `source_label` | string | Source label |
| `source_type` | string | Source type |
| `source_pgn` | number | PGN number (if applicable) |
| `meta` | string | Metadata information |

#### Aggregated Tier Schema (5s, 60s, 1h)

Aggregated tiers use a different schema optimized for statistical queries:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `bucket_time` | TIMESTAMP | Start of the aggregation time bucket |
| `context` | UTF8 | SignalK context |
| `path` | UTF8 | SignalK path |
| `value_avg` | DOUBLE | Average value in bucket |
| `value_min` | DOUBLE | Minimum value (NULL for angular paths) |
| `value_max` | DOUBLE | Maximum value (NULL for angular paths) |
| `sample_count` | INT64 | Number of raw samples aggregated |
| `value_sin_avg` | DOUBLE | Average of sin(value) — angular paths only, for lossless re-aggregation |
| `value_cos_avg` | DOUBLE | Average of cos(value) — angular paths only, for lossless re-aggregation |

#### Smart Data Types

The plugin now intelligently detects and preserves native data types:

- **Numbers**: Stored as `DOUBLE` (floating point) or `INT64` (integers)
- **Booleans**: Stored as `BOOLEAN` 
- **Strings**: Stored as `UTF8`
- **Objects**: Serialized to JSON and stored as `UTF8`
- **Mixed Types**: Falls back to `UTF8` when a path contains multiple data types

This provides better compression, faster queries, and proper type safety for data analysis.

## DuckDB Integration

### Query Examples

> **Globbing the Hive-partitioned store:** paths under `tier=.../context=.../path=.../` are partitioned as `year=*/day=*/`. Glob them with `year=*/day=*/*.parquet` — **not** `**/*.parquet`. The recursive `**` descends into the sibling `quarantine/`, `failed/`, `processed/`, and `repaired/` directories, and DuckDB will abort the whole query if it hits a quarantined 0-byte file (`too small to be a Parquet file`). The Query Database "Generate Query" button produces the correct glob automatically.

#### Basic Queries
```sql
-- Get latest 10 records from navigation position
SELECT * FROM read_parquet('/path/to/navigation/position/*.parquet', union_by_name=true)
ORDER BY received_timestamp DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Count total records
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM read_parquet('/path/to/navigation/position/*.parquet', union_by_name=true);

-- Filter by source
SELECT * FROM read_parquet('/path/to/environment/wind/*.parquet', union_by_name=true)
WHERE source_label = 'mqtt-weatherflow-udp'
ORDER BY received_timestamp DESC LIMIT 100;

-- Aggregate by hour
SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC('hour', received_timestamp::timestamp) as hour,
  AVG(value::double) as avg_value,
  COUNT(*) as record_count
FROM read_parquet('/path/to/data/*.parquet', union_by_name=true)

## History API Integration

The plugin provides full SignalK History API compliance, allowing you to query historical data using standard SignalK API endpoints with enhanced performance and filtering capabilities.

### Available Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description | Parameters |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| `/signalk/v1/history/values` | Get historical values for specified paths | **Standard patterns** (see below)<br>**Optional**: `resolution`, `includeMovingAverages`, `bbox`, `radius` |
| `/signalk/v1/history/contexts` | Get available vessel contexts for time range | **Time Range**: Any standard pattern (see below) ⚠️<br>Returns only contexts with data in specified range |
| `/signalk/v1/history/paths` | Get available SignalK paths for time range | **Time Range**: Any standard pattern (see below) ⚠️<br>Returns only paths with data in specified range |
| `/signalk/v2/api/history/*` | **Spec-compliant** - handled by registered `HistoryApi` provider | Per SignalK spec (ISO 8601 durations, no extensions) |

> **Note:** V2 routes (`/signalk/v2/api/history/*`) are handled by the registered `HistoryApi` provider (`history-provider.ts`) for SignalK server multi-provider support. V1 routes include signalk-parquet extensions (spatial filtering, shorthand durations, etc.) not available in V2.

> ⚠️ **Extension**: The `/contexts` and `/paths` endpoints accept time range parameters as **optional**. The official spec requires time parameters; without them, these endpoints return all available data (more permissive behavior).

> **Exact context ids (v0.7.44-beta.3+):** the contexts endpoints return vessel context strings exactly as recorded — resolved from the stored data rather than reconstructed from partition directory names, whose encoding is lossy. Earlier versions mangled UUID-identified vessels (`urn:mrn:signalk:uuid:…`, the default when no MMSI is configured) by turning the UUID's dashes into colons.

### Standard Time Range Patterns

The History API supports 5 standard SignalK time query patterns:

| Pattern | Parameters | Description | Example |
|---------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **1** | `duration` | Query back from now | `?duration=1h` |
| **2** | `from` + `duration` | Query forward from start | `?from=2025-01-01T00:00:00Z&duration=1h` |
| **3** | `to` + `duration` | Query backward to end | `?to=2025-01-01T12:00:00Z&duration=1h` |
| **4** | `from` | From start to now | `?from=2025-01-01T00:00:00Z` |
| **5** | `from` + `to` | Specific range | `?from=2025-01-01T00:00:00Z&to=2025-01-02T00:00:00Z` |

### Query Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Format | Examples |
|-----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| **Required for `/values`:** | | | |
| `paths` | SignalK paths with optional aggregation | `path:method` | `navigation.speedOverGround:average` |
| **Time Range:** | Use one of the 5 standard patterns above | | |
| `duration` | Time period (see Duration Formats below) | Multiple formats | `PT1H`, `3600`, `1h` |
| `from` | Start time (ISO 8601) | ISO datetime | `2025-01-01T00:00:00Z` |
| `to` | End time (ISO 8601) | ISO datetime | `2025-01-01T06:00:00Z` |
| **Optional:** | | | |
| `context` | Vessel context | `vessels.self` or `vessels.<id>` | `vessels.self` (default) |
| `resolution` | Time bucket size in **seconds** | Seconds or time expression | `60`, `1m` (1 minute buckets) |

#### Duration Formats

| Format | Example | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| ISO 8601 | `PT1H`, `PT30M`, `P1D`, `PT1H30M` | Standard ISO duration |
| Integer seconds | `3600`, `60` | Plain number as seconds |
| Shorthand ⚠️ | `1h`, `30m`, `5s`, `2d` | Human-friendly format (extension) |

> ⚠️ Shorthand format is a non-standard extension for convenience. Use ISO 8601 or integer seconds for maximum compatibility.

#### Resolution Parameter

> **BREAKING CHANGE (v0.7.0+)**: Resolution is now in **seconds** (was milliseconds).

| Old (v0.6.x) | New (v0.7.0+) |
|--------------|---------------|
| `?resolution=60000` | `?resolution=60` or `?resolution=1m` |
| `?resolution=5000` | `?resolution=5` or `?resolution=5s` |
| `?resolution=300000` | `?resolution=300` or `?resolution=5m` |

#### Aggregation Methods

| Method | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `average` | Average of values in bucket | `path:average` |
| `min` | Minimum value in bucket | `path:min` |
| `max` | Maximum value in bucket | `path:max` |
| `first` | First value in bucket | `path:first` |
| `last` | Last value in bucket | `path:last` |
| `mid` | Median value in bucket | `path:mid` |
| `sma` | Simple Moving Average, window default 5 samples (returns only smoothed value) | `path:sma:5` |
| `ema` | Exponential Moving Average, alpha default 0.2 (returns only smoothed value) | `path:ema:0.2` |

**SMA/EMA as aggregation methods (official SignalK syntax):**
```bash
# SMA with window of 5 - returns ONLY the smoothed value (V1 with shorthand duration)
curl "http://localhost:3000/signalk/v1/history/values?duration=1h&paths=navigation.speedOverGround:sma:5"

# EMA with alpha of 0.3 - returns ONLY the smoothed value (V1 with shorthand duration)
curl "http://localhost:3000/signalk/v1/history/values?duration=1h&paths=environment.wind.speedApparent:ema:0.3"
```

> **Angular-aware smoothing (v0.7.43+, V2 provider routes):** `sma`/`ema` first bucket values exactly like `average`, then apply the moving window. Paths with `rad` units (heading, COG, wind direction) are smoothed with a circular (vector) mean so the 0/2π wrap doesn't average 359°/1° toward 180°, and `navigation.position` longitude is smoothed across the ±180° antimeridian correctly (latitude linearly). Buckets with null/NaN values pass through unsmoothed rather than contaminating the moving average.

#### Filtering by Source

Append `|<sourceRef>` to a path to restrict it to a single SignalK source. This
is useful when several devices publish the same path (e.g. multiple GPS
receivers or heading sensors) and you want the history of just one of them. The
source reference is the delta's `$source` value, and the filter applies after
any optional aggregation method.

| Format | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `path\|sourceRef` | Filter a path to one source | `navigation.headingMagnetic\|n2k-on-ve.can0.115` |
| `path:method\|sourceRef` | Aggregate and filter by source | `navigation.speedOverGround:max\|n2k-on-ve.can0.115` |

```bash
# Heading from a specific compass over the last hour
curl "http://localhost:3000/signalk/v1/history/values?duration=1h&paths=navigation.headingMagnetic|n2k-on-ve.can0.115"
```

Source filtering always reads raw data: aggregated tiers blend every source
into each time bucket, so they cannot be filtered by source. Each `values`
entry in the response echoes the `sourceRef` it was restricted to.

#### Extension Parameters (non-standard)

| Parameter | Description | Format | Examples |
|-----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `paths` ⚠️ | Extended smoothing syntax: `path:method:smoothing:param` (returns raw AND smoothed) | Extended format | `navigation.speedOverGround:average:sma:5` |
| `includeMovingAverages` ⚠️ | Include EMA/SMA calculations | `true` or `1` | `includeMovingAverages=true` |
| `bbox` ⚠️ | Bounding box filter: `west,south,east,north` | Coordinates | `bbox=-74.5,40.2,-73.8,40.9` |
| `radius` ⚠️ | Radius filter: `lon,lat,meters` (GeoJSON convention) | Coordinates + meters | `radius=-73.981,40.646,100` |

> ⚠️ **Extensions**: Parameters marked with ⚠️ are non-standard extensions to the SignalK History API specification. They provide additional functionality but may not be supported by other SignalK history providers.

### Query Examples

#### Pattern 1: Duration Only (Query back from now)
```bash
# Last hour of wind data
curl "http://localhost:3000/signalk/v1/history/values?duration=1h&paths=environment.wind.speedApparent"

# Last 30 minutes with moving averages
curl "http://localhost:3000/signalk/v1/history/values?duration=30m&paths=environment.wind.speedApparent&includeMovingAverages=true"

```

#### Pattern 2: From + Duration (Query forward)
```bash
# 6 hours forward from specific time
curl "http://localhost:3000/signalk/v1/history/values?from=2025-01-01T00:00:00Z&duration=6h&paths=navigation.position"
```

#### Pattern 3: To + Duration (Query backward)

# From specific time until now
curl "http://localhost:3000/signalk/v1/history/values?from=2025-01-01T00:00:00Z&paths=navigation.speedOverGround"
```

#### Pattern 5: From + To (Specific range)
```bash
# Specific 24-hour period
curl "http://localhost:3000/signalk/v1/history/values?from=2025-01-01T00:00:00Z&to=2025-01-02T00:00:00Z&paths=navigation.position"
```

#### Advanced Query Examples

**Multiple paths with time alignment:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/signalk/v1/history/values?duration=6h&paths=environment.wind.angleApparent,environment.wind.speedApparent,navigation.position&resolution=1m"
```

**Multiple aggregations of same path:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/signalk/v1/history/values?from=2025-01-01T00:00:00Z&to=2025-01-01T06:00:00Z&paths=environment.wind.speedApparent:average,environment.wind.speedApparent:min,environment.wind.speedApparent:max&resolution=60"
```

**With moving averages for trend analysis:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/signalk/v1/history/values?duration=24h&paths=electrical.batteries.512.voltage&includeMovingAverages=true&resolution=5m"
```

**Different temporal samples:**

```

**Using ISO 8601 duration format:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/signalk/v1/history/values?duration=PT1H30M&paths=navigation.speedOverGround&resolution=30"
```

**Using integer seconds for duration:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/signalk/v1/history/values?duration=3600&paths=navigation.speedOverGround&resolution=10s"
```

#### Context and Path Discovery

```

#### Duration Formats
- `30s` - 30 seconds
- `15m` - 15 minutes
- `2h` - 2 hours
- `1d` - 1 day

#### Spatial Filtering

Filter data by geographic location using bounding boxes or radius queries:

**Bounding Box Filter:**
```bash
# Position data within a bounding box (west,south,east,north)
curl "http://localhost:3000/signalk/v1/history/values?duration=1h&paths=navigation.position&bbox=-74.5,40.2,-73.8,40.9"
```

**Radius Filter:**
```bash
# Position data within 100m of a point (lon,lat,meters — GeoJSON convention)
curl "http://localhost:3000/signalk/v1/history/values?duration=1h&paths=navigation.position&radius=-73.981,40.646,100"
```

**Spatial Correlation (filter non-position paths by location):**
```bash
# Wind data when vessel was within 100m of point
curl "http://localhost:3000/signalk/v1/history/values?duration=24h&paths=environment.wind.speedApparent&radius=-73.981,40.646,100"

# Multiple paths filtered by bounding box
curl "http://localhost:3000/signalk/v1/history/values?duration=7d&paths=environment.wind.speedApparent,environment.depth.belowKeel&bbox=-74.0,40.6,-73.9,40.7"

```

**How Spatial Correlation Works:**
- For **position paths** (e.g., `navigation.position`): Filters directly on lat/lon
- For **non-position paths** (e.g., `environment.wind.speedApparent`): First queries position data to find timestamps when vessel was within the spatial filter, then returns only data from those times
- Spatial correlation always uses `navigation.position` for location lookup

#### Query Data Hierarchy

Queries resolve data from a three-tier hierarchy, selected automatically based on date ranges:

1. **Local tiered Parquet** — Primary source. Uses aggregation tiers (`raw`, `5s`, `60s`, `1h`) based on query resolution. Data available from first export through yesterday.
2. **Cloud supplement (S3/R2)** — For dates before local data starts (older than `retentionDays`). DuckDB queries cloud storage directly without downloading files first.
3. **SQLite buffer** — Today's live data, not yet exported to Parquet. Bucketed to match the query resolution.

For queries spanning multiple sources, results are combined with UNION.

**Cloud Query Optimization:**
DuckDB's native cloud storage support provides:
- **Partition pruning**: Hive structure (`year=/day=`) allows skipping irrelevant files
- **Predicate pushdown**: WHERE clauses filter at Parquet level before transfer
- **Projection pushdown**: Only SELECT columns are transferred
- **Combined effect**: 70-99% reduction vs downloading full files

**Requirements for cloud queries:**
- Cloud upload must be configured (`provider: 's3'` or `'r2'`)
- Valid credentials configured
- Data must be uploaded using Hive partition structure

### Timestamp Handling

All timestamps follow ISO 8601 conventions:
- **Bare timestamps** (e.g., `2025-08-13T09:00:00`) are treated as server local time
- **Z-suffix** (e.g., `2025-08-13T09:00:00Z`) is UTC
- **Explicit offset** (e.g., `2025-08-13T09:00:00-04:00`) is parsed as-is

All response timestamps are in server local time with offset (e.g., `2025-10-20T12:34:04-04:00`).

```bash
# Bare timestamp — interpreted as server local time
curl "http://localhost:3000/signalk/v1/history/values?context=vessels.self&to=2025-08-13T09:00:00&duration=1h&paths=navigation.position"

# Explicit UTC
curl "http://localhost:3000/signalk/v1/history/values?context=vessels.self&to=2025-08-13T09:00:00Z&duration=1h&paths=navigation.position"

# Explicit offset
curl "http://localhost:3000/signalk/v1/history/values?context=vessels.self&to=2025-08-13T09:00:00-04:00&duration=1h&paths=navigation.position"
```

**Get available contexts:**
```bash
curl "http://localhost:3000/signalk/v1/history/contexts"
```

### Time Alignment and Bucketing

The History API automatically aligns data from different paths using time bucketing to solve the common problem of misaligned timestamps. This enables:

- **Plotting**: Data points align properly on charts  
- **Correlation**: Compare values from different sensors at the same time
- **Export**: Clean, aligned datasets for analysis

**Key Features:**
- **Smart Type Handling**: Automatically handles numeric values (wind speed) and JSON objects (position)
- **Robust Aggregation**: Uses proper SQL type casting to prevent type errors
- **Configurable Resolution**: Time bucket size in seconds (default: auto-calculated based on time range)
- **Multiple Aggregation Methods**: `average` for numeric data, `first` for complex objects

**Parameters:**
- `resolution` - Time bucket size in seconds (default: auto-calculated)
- **Aggregation methods**: `average`, `min`, `max`, `first`, `last`, `mid`, `middle_index`

**Aggregation Methods:**
- **`average`** - Average value in time bucket (default for numeric data)
- **`min`** - Minimum value in time bucket
- **`max`** - Maximum value in time bucket
- **`first`** - First value in time bucket (default for objects)
- **`last`** - Last value in time bucket
- **`mid`** ⚠️ - Median value (average of middle values for even counts) - *extension*
- **`middle_index`** ⚠️ - Middle value by index (first of two middle values for even counts) - *extension*

**When to Use Each Method:**
- **Numeric data** (wind speed, voltage, etc.): Use `average`, `min`, `max` for statistics
- **Position data**: Use `first`, `last`, `middle_index` for specific readings
- **String/object data**: Avoid `mid` (unpredictable), prefer `first`, `last`, `middle_index`
- **Multiple stats**: Query same path with different methods (e.g., `wind:average,wind:max`)

### Response Format

The History API returns time-aligned data in standard SignalK format.

      "path": "environment.wind.speedApparent.sma",
      "method": "sma"
    },
    {
      "path": "navigation.position",
      "method": "first"
    }
  ],
  "data": [
    ["2025-01-01T00:00:00Z", 12.5, 12.5, 12.5, {"latitude": 37.7749, "longitude": -122.4194}],
    ["2025-01-01T00:01:00Z", 13.2, 12.64, 12.85, {"latitude": 37.7750, "longitude": -122.4195}],
    ["2025-01-01T00:02:00Z", 11.8, 12.45, 12.5, {"latitude": 37.7751, "longitude": -122.4196}]
  ]
}
```

**Notes**:
- Each data array element is `[timestamp, value1, value2, ...]` corresponding to the paths in the `values` array
- Moving averages (EMA/SMA) are **opt-in** - add `includeMovingAverages=true` to include them
- EMA/SMA are only calculated for numeric values; non-numeric values (objects, strings) show `null` for their EMA/SMA columns
- Without `includeMovingAverages`, response size is ~66% smaller

#### Response Extensions (non-standard) ⚠️

When using extension parameters, the response may include additional non-standard fields:

| Field | Added by | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `meta.autoConfigured` | Auto-discovery | Indicates paths were auto-configured for recording |

These fields are extensions and may not be present in responses from other SignalK history providers.


## Moving Averages (EMA & SMA)

The plugin calculates **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)** and **Simple Moving Average (SMA)** for numeric values, providing enhanced trend analysis capabilities. There are two ways to enable smoothing:

### Per-Path Smoothing Syntax

Apply smoothing directly in the path specification using the `path:method:smoothing:param` syntax:

```bash
# SMA with 5-point window
curl "http://localhost:3000/signalk/v1/history/values?duration=1h&paths=navigation.speedOverGround:average:sma:5"

# EMA with alpha=0.3
curl "http://localhost:3000/signalk/v1/history/values?duration=1h&paths=environment.wind.speedApparent:max:ema:0.3"

# Mixed: some paths with smoothing, some without
curl "http://localhost:3000/signalk/v1/history/values?duration=1h&paths=navigation.speedOverGround:average:sma:5,navigation.courseOverGround:average"

# SMA with default period (10)
curl "http://localhost:3000/signalk/v1/history/values?duration=1h&paths=navigation.speedOverGround:average:sma"

# EMA with default alpha (0.2)
curl "http://localhost:3000/signalk/v1/history/values?duration=1h&paths=navigation.speedOverGround:average:ema"
```

**Path Syntax Format:** `path:aggregateMethod:smoothingType:smoothingParam`
- `path` - SignalK path (e.g., `navigation.speedOverGround`)
- `aggregateMethod` - Aggregation method: `average`, `min`, `max`, `first`, `last`, `mid` (default: `average`)
- `smoothingType` - `sma` (Simple Moving Average) or `ema` (Exponential Moving Average)
- `smoothingParam` - For SMA: window size (default: 10), for EMA: alpha value 0-1 (default: 0.2)

**Per-Path Response Format:**
```json
{
  "values": [
    {
      "path": "navigation.speedOverGround",
      "method": "average"
    },
    {
      "path": "navigation.speedOverGround",
      "method": "average",
      "smoothing": "sma",
      "window": 5
    }
  ],
  "data": [
    ["2025-01-01T00:00:00Z", 5.05, 5.05],
    ["2025-01-01T00:01:00Z", 5.12, 5.09],
    ["2025-01-01T00:02:00Z", 4.98, 5.05]
  ]
}
```

**Note:** With per-path smoothing, the response includes both the raw value AND the smoothed value as separate columns. Paths without smoothing specified only get a single column.

### Global Moving Averages (Legacy)

**History API:**
```bash
# Add includeMovingAverages=true to any query
curl "http://localhost:3000/signalk/v1/history/values?duration=1h&paths=environment.wind.speedApparent&includeMovingAverages=true"
```

**Default Behavior (v0.5.6+):**
- Moving averages are **opt-in** - not included by default
- Reduces response size by ~66% when not needed
- Better API compliance with SignalK specification

**Legacy Behavior (pre-v0.5.6):**
- Moving averages were automatically included for all queries
- To maintain old behavior, add `includeMovingAverages=true` to all requests

### Calculation Details

#### Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
- **Period**: ~10 equivalent (α = 0.2)
- **Formula**: `EMA = α × currentValue + (1 - α) × previousEMA`
- **Characteristic**: Responds faster to recent changes, emphasizes recent data
- **Use Case**: Trend detection, rapid response to data changes

#### Simple Moving Average (SMA)
- **Period**: 10 data points
- **Formula**: Average of the last 10 values
- **Characteristic**: Smooths out fluctuations, equal weight to all values in window
- **Use Case**: Noise reduction, general trend analysis

### Data Flow & Continuity

```javascript
// Initial Data Load (isIncremental: false)
Point 1: Value=5.0, EMA=5.0,   SMA=5.0
Point 2: Value=6.0, EMA=5.2,   SMA=5.5
Point 3: Value=4.0, EMA=5.0,   SMA=5.0

// Incremental Updates (isIncremental: true)
Point 4: Value=7.0, EMA=5.4,   SMA=5.5  // Continues from previous EMA
Point 5: Value=5.5, EMA=5.42,  SMA=5.5  // Rolling 10-point SMA window
```

### Key Features

- 🎛️ **Opt-In**: Add `includeMovingAverages=true` to enable (v0.5.6+)
- ✅ **Memory Efficient**: SMA maintains rolling 10-point window
- ✅ **Non-Numeric Handling**: Non-numeric values (strings, objects) show `null` for EMA/SMA
- ✅ **Precision**: Values rounded to 3 decimal places to prevent floating-point noise
- ⚡ **Performance**: Smaller response sizes when not needed

### Real-world Applications

**Marine Data Examples:**
- **Wind Speed**: EMA detects gusts quickly, SMA shows general wind conditions
- **Battery Voltage**: EMA shows charging/discharging trends, SMA indicates overall battery health
- **Engine RPM**: EMA responds to throttle changes, SMA shows average operating level
- **Water Temperature**: EMA detects thermal changes, SMA provides stable baseline

**Available in:**
- 📊 **History API**: Add `includeMovingAverages=true` to include EMA/SMA calculations


## Cloud Storage (S3 / Cloudflare R2)

### Configuration

Set `provider` to `s3` or `r2` in the cloud upload configuration. Cloud uploads run automatically as part of the daily export pipeline — after Parquet files are created, they are uploaded to the configured cloud provider.

```json
{
  "cloudUpload": {
    "provider": "s3",
    "bucket": "my-marine-data",
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "keyPrefix": "marine-data/",
    "accessKeyId": "...",
    "secretAccessKey": "..."
  }
}
```

For Cloudflare R2, use `provider: "r2"` and supply `accountId` instead of `region`.

### Cloud Key Structure

With prefix `marine-data/` and Hive partitioning:
```
marine-data/tier=raw/context=vessels__self/path=navigation__position/year=2026/day=062/signalk_data_2026-03-03T0400.parquet
```

## Daily Export

The plugin uses a simplified daily export pipeline:

1. **Data Collection**: SignalK data is buffered in crash-safe SQLite WAL database
2. **Daily Export**: At configurable hour (default: 4 AM UTC), exports previous day's data
3. **Direct Consolidation**: Creates one Parquet file per context/path/day (no separate merge step)
4. **Timestamped Files**: Each export uses current timestamp for unique filenames
5. **S3 Upload**: Uploads daily files if configured

**Note**: The previous 5-minute interval export and separate consolidation step have been removed. This simplifies the pipeline and creates cleaner daily files directly.

## Startup Sequence

When the plugin starts, it runs the following initialization steps:

1. **Configuration & State** — Load plugin config, vessel identity, output directory, cloud credentials
2. **SQLite Buffer** — Open WAL-mode database; auto-migrate legacy `buffer_records` table to per-path tables if needed
3. **Cloud Client** — Initialize S3 or R2 SDK if a cloud provider is configured
4. **DuckDB Pool** — Initialize connection pool; attach SQLite buffer for federated queries; register cloud credentials
5. **Data Subscriptions** — Subscribe to configured SignalK paths and start threshold monitoring
6. **Periodic Save** — Start flush interval (default: every 30s) from memory buffer to SQLite
7. **Daily Export Schedule** — Schedule next export at configured UTC hour (default: 4 AM); includes aggregation and cloud upload
8. **Startup Catch-Up** (10s delay) — Export any unexported historical data from SQLite, re-aggregate affected dates, and sync recent files to cloud (7-day lookback, raw-tier-only prefix scan)
9. **History API** — Register HTTP routes and SignalK HistoryApi provider
10. **Auto-Discovery** — Initialize service for on-demand path configuration

## Performance Characteristics

- **Memory Usage**: Configurable buffer sizes (default 1000 records)
- **Disk I/O**: Efficient batch writes with configurable intervals
- **CPU Usage**: Minimal - mostly I/O bound operations
- **Network**: Optional S3 uploads with retry logic

## Legacy Notes

### Upgrading to 0.7.41-beta.3: Faster Startup Sweep

The startup sweep that quarantines crash-truncated (0-byte) parquet files is now incremental, keyed to a watermark file at `<dataDir>/.last-empty-sweep`. The **first** start after upgrading does one full scan of the store to establish the watermark (on very large stores this can take a minute or two), and **every start after that only inspects directories changed since the previous start** — typically near-instant. No action is required; the watermark file is created automatically. See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for details.

### Upgrading from 0.5.0-beta.3: Consolidation Bug Fix

If upgrading from versions prior to 0.5.0-beta.4, you may have nested `processed` directories from a recursive consolidation bug:

```bash
# Check for nested processed directories
find data -name "*processed*" -type d | head -20

# Remove ALL nested processed directories (RECOMMENDED)
find data -name "processed" -type d -exec rm -rf {} +
```

The `processed` directories contain legacy files from the old consolidation system. The new daily export pipeline no longer uses this directory.

### Legacy Flat File Structure

Pre-Hive versions stored data in a flat directory structure:
```
output_directory/
├── vessels/
│   └── self/
│       ├── navigation/
│       │   └── position/
│       │       └── signalk_data_20250716T120000.parquet
└── processed/
```

Use the Migration API to convert legacy files to Hive partitioning.
